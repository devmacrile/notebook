analysis vs. synthesis

Periodicity in time => frequency
e.g. number of repetitions/cycles in a second, harmonic motion

Periodicity in space => period
e.g. quantity/measurement of repeating pattern, say length

These two are not the same; different feel, arise in different problems
But do come together in, e.g., wave motion

Again, two descriptors come in: frequency and wavelength.
In the case of wave motion, there is a relationship between these two
phenomena determined by the velocity (distance=rate*time)
=> reciprocal relationship between the frequency and the wavelength

In the analysis/synthesis of fourier series, there will be a reciprocal
relationship between the frequency and the wavelength.  This is something to which to be
attuned.  Will see this constantly.

"Somehow I want to use fourier analysis on this problem.. what are the reciprocal relationships?"

Why does periodicity allow mathematical description?  Where does math come in?
Because there are simple mathematical functions (sin/cos) that are periodic (repeat) and so can
be used to model periodic phenomena.

cos(t), sin(t) are periodic of period 2pi
cos(t + 2pi) = cos(t), sin(t + 2pi) = sin(t)
Why?
Because sin and cos are associated with the simplest object that regularly repeats: the circle!
Fundamental link between trigonometric functions and periodicity
