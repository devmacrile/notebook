Important condition is integrability (and an easy one to verify)
Say f(t) is square integrable if the integral of the square is finite.
(i.e integral(0, 1) abs(f(t))^2 dt < infinity)

If f(t) if periodic, square integrable
then you form the fourier coefficients as before, and
the integral between f(t) and the fourier coefficient sum (over n)
from 0 to 1 tends to 0 as n tends to infinity.

f,g square integrable on [0,1], then their inner product (generalization
of dot product for vectors) is:
(f, g) = integral(0, 1) f(t) * g(t)_bar dt    (where _bar indicates complex conjugate)
Allows you to define orthogonality; when two vectors are perpendicular.
Orthogonal if (f, g) = 0

^ This is the definition.  Where does the definition come from?
The desire to satisfy the pythagorean theorme.

Norm of a function: (f, f) = ||f||^2  (dot product with itself is norm squared)

Pythag thm: f is orthogonal to g if and only if the norm^2 of f+g
||f + g|| ^2 = ||f||^2 + ||g||^2
if and only if (f, g) = 0

Why?
Vector addition.  vectors u, v, then u + v is vector from source of u to tip of v.
Forms a right triangle, so ||u + v||^2 = ||u||^2 + ||v||^2
u+v /|
   /_| v
    u
Trick is extending this from vectors to functions, via analogy

(e^(2*pi*i*n*t), e^(2*pi*i*m*t)) = {0 if m != n, 1 if m=n}
These are orthonormal functions.
Might say: "I should, via this analogy, be able to visualize what it means
for two functions to be orthogonal."  NO! No reason you should be able to
visualize when two functions are orthogonal.
It's reasoning by analogy; establish that these functions are orthogonal,
and apply intuition about orthogonality to these functions.  That's the beauty.

The fourier coefficients are the projections of these functions onto 
complex exponentials.
One of the ways you use inner products is to define projections (orthogonal projections
in particular).
User inner product for vectors to define and compute projections.
If u, v are two unit vectors, then projection of v onto u is (v, u),
projection.  Breaking a vector down into it's component parts.
vector projection is (v, u)u (since u is unit vector)
What is the projection for function?
The fourier coefficition is _exactly_ a projection.
The nth fourier coefficient is _exactly_ the projection of f
onto the nth complex exponential.
And what is the Fourier series?
It's to write the sum from -inf to inf over k of f's projection onto 
the kth complex exponential multiplied by that kth complex exponential.
Trying to decompose the function into simpler components, which in this case
happen to be the complex exponentials!
Another way to say this:
The complex exponentials create an orthonormal basis for these square integral
periodic functions. (not the only one! i.e. wavelets are a different basis)
The coefficients, as they are for any orthonormal basis, are the projections of 
the function onto the bases

It's this point of view that is important to carry forward! 
Reason by analogy here.

Application?
Rayleigh's identity
integral(0, 1) |f(t)|^2 dt = sum_k(-inf, inf) |f_hat(k)|^2
The length of a vector     =  the sum of the squares of its components

The components of a function are its Fourier coefficients
