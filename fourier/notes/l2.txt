Identifying the fourier series with the mathematical study of periodicity

Big point of the course: learn to see symmetry; periodicity is a type of symmetry

Periodic phenomena are generally very complicated.. how can we use very simple 
periodic functions (sin/cos) to model complicated periodic phenomena?
That's the topic of this lecture

How high should we aim?  How general should we hope to get?
Pretty high.

Not all phenomena are periodic
But, can still apply...
Can force periodicity by repeating finite pattern (signal) of interest
   Called periodization.  
   Don't have a periodic phenomena?  Make it periodic, and see if periodic analysis
   can be applied

Important, if not obvious, maxim:
If we "know" a periodic function on an interval of length 1 (not just a particular interval,
but any interval), then we know it anywhere.

Can modify and combine sin(2*pi*t), cos(2*pi*t) to model general periodic signals, period 1.
Maxim: One period, many frequencies (the big idea).
What does this mean exactly?
e.g. sin(2*pi*t) has period 1, frequency 1
     sin(4*pi*t) has period 1/2, frequency 2, but also has period 1 (that larger _double_ pattern repeats)
     sin(6*pi*t) has period 1/3, frequency 3, but also has period 1 (for ^ same reason)
Combination
     sin(2*pi*t) + sin(4*pi*t) + sin(6*pi*t)
     The period of this sum is 1 ("slowest" has to catch up, gcd-like)
     One period in the sum; many frequencies, but only one period
     So for complicated periodic signals, better to talk about the frequencies that go into it
     rather than the period.  Fix the period to have length 1, talk about constituting frequencies.

Had a summation written out describing sums of sine/cosine.
But, there is a better representation.
"By far better to represent sine and cosine via complex exponentials and write the sum that way."

e ^ (2*pi*i*k*t) = cos(2*pi*k*t) + i*sin(2*pi*k*t)

Then can convert a trigonometric sum to the form utilizing complex exponentials.
There is a very important symmetry property here with this substitution.  Wind up with complex
numbers, but not just any complex numbers.  They satisfy the symmetry property, and because
of this the total sum is _real_.

complex conjugate refresher: (a + bi), then (a - bi) is the complex conjugate
notation is bar over variable representing complex number (i.e. capital C)
complex number equal to its conjugate => it's real

Now, again, how general can this be?
In a form now, algebraically, where we can ask this question.
Fundamental question:  have a function f(t) periodic of t
Can we write this function in the form above?  can we write this function in terms of sines and cosines?
Answer? Next time.  (But, yeah)

Suppose we can do this.  What has to happen?
What are the mystery coefficients Ck in terms of f?  (unknowns in expression are the coefficients, can we solve for them?)
Solve for the Ck.  Start by isolating the mth coefficient Cm.
Cool, that's as far as we can go via algebra... Next?  Try differentiation... derivatives won't
work, but integrals will.  So integrate both sides from 0 to 1 (one period all we need!)
Good chunk of that will integrate to 0 => Cm will be a much simpler integral.
